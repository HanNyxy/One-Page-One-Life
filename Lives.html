          <h2>A magical door owner</h2>
          <p class="story">Hidden in a quiet alley, there’s a single wooden door. Step through it, and it could lead anywhere — a sunlit meadow in another century, the deck of a ship on a molten sea, or the middle of a grand ballroom mid-waltz. You never know where you’ll end up, but the owner always knows exactly where he wants to go.</p>
          <p class="fun-fact">This door changes its location every full moon — even the owner sometimes has to go looking for it.</p>

          <h2>A Ghibli Art Life</h2>
          <p class="story">Mornings bathed in soft sunlight and the scent of fresh tea. Cherry blossoms danced quietly in your small garden. Days passed gently with sketching, reading, and clouds painting stories. Life here was a slow, beautiful painting.</p>
